For some reason, none of the explanations were doing it for me. All explanations told me the same thing over and over again. I was not able to find the motive behind this data structure, intuition behind this data structure.</p><p>Finally, I decided to sit down, check some examples, diagram them out, check stack overflow and understand it. I now understand the beauty of this data structure, and I think, I can explain it. For those who have gone through this and also for those who don&#39;t want to go through this phase, I am writing this post..</p><p>Let me tell you one thing, this is going to be a longer post. I will try to cover all the things associated with it. I have included examples for understanding. Give it half an hour, you will surely get new thing to learn.</p><p>Wasting no time, lets have a well defined problem.</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>We will be given an array. And we are asked to answer few queries. </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Queries will be of two types:-</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>1) Update X Y : Increment value at Xth index by Y.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>2) Sum L R : Print sum of values at index L to R inclusive.</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Lets have a look at other approaches in short, before going for BIT (Binary Indexed Tree), so that you will know the need of BIT.</p><ol><li>We can <strong>update</strong> any value in the array in single step. So, update operation will need time<code>O(1)</code>. Also, for <strong>sum</strong> operation, we can traverse the array and find sum. That operation will take time <code>O(n)</code>in worst case.</li><li>One more thing we can do. At each index, we will store the cumulative frequency i.e. we will store sum of all elements before it including itself. We can construct this new array in . Lets say this array as CF[]. After that, All the <strong>sum</strong> operation will take time since we will just subtract CF[L-1] from CF[R] to get the answer for sum L R. But well, we will need to construct CF[] or at least update CF[] every-time update operation is made. The worst case time required for this will be .</li></ol><p>Since, the queries are huge in number, we can not always afford time complexity <code>O(n)</code>too. So, here comes the BIT for our rescue.</p><hr><h2 id="binary-indexed-tree-or-fenwick-tree" tabindex="-1"><strong>BINARY INDEXED TREE</strong> or <strong>FENWICK TREE</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#binary-indexed-tree-or-fenwick-tree" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**BINARY INDEXED TREE** or **FENWICK TREE**&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>CONSTRUCTION of BIT:</strong></p><p>Lets have an example with us. Input array is:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>[ 5 ] [ 1 ] [ 6 ] [ 4 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 3 ]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  1     2     3     4     5     6     7</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, think of what we did in 2nd approach. For each index, we were storing sum of all elements before that element to that index. Right? But because of that, we were needed to change values at all locations for every update.</p><p>Now think it this way, what if we store sum of some elements at each index? i.e. Each index will store sum of some elements the number may vary. Similarly, for update operation also, we will need to update only few values, not all. We will see how!</p><p>Formally, we will create some benchmarks. Each benchmark will store sum of all elements before that element; but other than those benchmarks, no other point will store sum of all elements, they will store sum of few elements. Okay, if we can do this, what we will need to do to get sum at any point is - intelligently choosing right combination of positions so as to get sum of all elements before that point. And then we will extend it to sum of elements from L to R (for this, the approach will be same as we did in second approach). We will see that afterwards.</p><p>Now, having done the base work, lets move ahead.</p><p>Before telling HOW will we be doing, I would like to tell you WHAT are we going to do. To remind you, we are going to create BIT[] of given input array.</p><p><strong>WHAT:</strong></p><p>This is a kind of manual process I am showing.</p><p>The benchmarks I was talking about are the powers of 2. Each index, if it is a power of 2, will store the sum of all elements before that. And we will apply this repetitively so as to get what each index will store.</p><p>Suppose, we have an array of 16 elements, [1 .. 16].</p><p>Powers of 2 are:- 1, 2, 4, 8, 16</p><p>These index will store sum of all elements before them.</p><p>Fine?</p><p>What about others?</p><p>Divide this array in two halves:- we get [1..8] and [9 .. 16].</p><p>Now think recursively what we did for array of 16, apply same for this, okay?</p><p>Seems like little bouncer?

If we treat 0 as LEFT and 1 as RIGHT, each node tells you the path to be followed from root to reach that node. Really? Have example, say node 5, which has 10 there, i.e. RIGHT and LEFT. This is the path we need to follow from root to 5. Cool thing, right?</p><p>The reason why this is important to us is, our <strong>sum</strong> and <strong>update</strong> operations depends on the this path. Are they not? You remember, Left link, right link, right? During a <strong>sum</strong>, we just care about the left links we follow. During an <strong>update</strong>, we just care about the right links we follow. This binary indexed tree does all of this super efficiently by just using the bits in the index.</p><p>The key thing behind the efficiency of BIT is:</p><blockquote><p>Given any index n, the next node on the path from root to that index where we go right is directly calculated by RESETing i.e. &#39;0&#39; the last (right most) SET-bit from the binary representation of .
